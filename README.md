I am a developer of open-source scientific software, and a scientist trained in acoustic phonetics, speech perception, and auditory neuroscience.
My scientific interest broadly centers on the perception and representation of speech sounds.
I'm (probably) most known for my work on [MNE-Python](https://mne.tools).
